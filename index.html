I started building macOS apps in 2003 and worked with newer Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS) since they were introduced.</p><p>I am always happy to dive into complex challenges and write code that is easy to read, easy to test, and easy to delete.</p><h3>Are you available?</h3><p><em>Yes. I'm ready to talk about new projects.</em> Please contact me at <a href="mailto:mail@mxgzf.com">mail@mxgzf.com</a> or find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximiliangoetzfried/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Maximilian_Goetzfried2">XING</a>.</p><p>My hourly rate is 100 € plus 19 % tax. I'd be happy to offer you a fixed price if your project has a well-defined scope.</p><h3>Can you work on-site?</h3><p>As a father of two kids (6 and 9 years old), <em>i prefer to work remotely</em>. But i can certainly manage to occasionally work on-site, even for multiple days or a whole week, especially around important deadlines.</p><p>I live in Gießen (Germany, GMT+1) which you can find on <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?address=Schöne Aussicht 22, 35396 Giessen, Germany&ll=50.608930,8.698648&q=Schöne Aussicht 22&_ext=EiYp+5kwQV5NSUAxeEshhBViIUA5eW9WnYROSUBB+Foy5FRpIUBQBA%3D%3D">Apple Maps</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maximilian+Götzfried/@50.608959,8.698794,6z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47bc5f4c2cfa9f7f:0xec04a8a568cecc43">Google Maps</a>. If you like, we can have our first meetup in my home office. I'd be happy to show you where i live and how i work.</p><p>Most of my previous clients were located in Germany and Switzerland, but i'd be happy to work world-wide. I speak English and German.</p><h3>What is your experience?</h3><p>I shipped my first software in the late 90s. A software that hacks the binary of Internet Explorer for Mac to hide a specific UI element. Created with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit">ResEdit</a> and published as freeware by a german magazine on CD-ROM.</p><p>I started developing Mac apps in 2003. I first focused on developing layout software, written in Objective-C and based on Carbon and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Type_Services_for_Unicode_Imaging">ATSUI</a>.</p><p>In 2006 i built <a href="http://liquifile.info/">Liquifile</a>, a file manager with a custom dynamic UI, which you can see in action in an <a href="http://liquifile.info/movie.htm">older video</a>. I was awarded by Apple for my work on this app with a Student Scholarship for the WWDC conference 2006 in San Francisco.</p><p>In 2010, i wrote two long articles for the first issue of "Mac Developer", a german magazine for Mac developers. I covered two topics: Mac OS X Snow Leopard and the newly introduced Grand Central Dispatch.</p><p>Starting in 2008, i built mostly iOS apps. Throughout the years i finished over 100 projects for my clients. Here are just a few examples:</p><ul><li>For CELLULAR AG (Hamburg), i built five news apps with fast scrolling feeds and a custom animated GIF engine, a dating app with a chat and a nutrition tracker app.</li><li>I built a city performance tool for Promotion Software GmbH (Tübingen) that dynamically generates a financial and environment report (a 20-page-PDF with tabular data and charts).</li><li>I also built a news app with SMS payment option for Voice Publishing AG (Zürich), an urban art guide for Neuland + Herzer (Frankfurt), a police app for kernpunkt GmbH (Köln), a dictionary app for Kaden Verlag (Heidelberg), a search app for telegate / 11880 AG and many more.</li></ul><p>All my apps are native apps. I prefer writing code in Swift and Objective-C but i am familiar with C and C++, too. I also know how to write JavaScript for a <code>WKWebView</code>.</p><p>I never stop learning new things. That's why i already have experiences with new frameworks like SwiftUI and Combine. I also follow the Swift community very closely. That's why i'm already familiar with recently released repositories like <a href="apple/swift-argument-parser">apple/swift-argument-parser</a> and <a href="icanzilb/TimelaneCombine">icanzilb/TimelaneCombine</a>.</p><h3>Can you show me your code?</h3><p>Sure. Most of my work is closed-source and under NDA but you can find some of my code online:</p><p>In 2015 i published a status bar app at <a href="https://github.com/mxgzf/MXStatusMenu">mxgzf/MXStatusMenu</a> that i wrote with Swift 1.2 und Xcode 6.3. It was featured in an issue of the MacDevWeekly newsletter and listed on <a href="https://github.com/juan-sanzone-olx/awesome-swift-1">uhub/awesome-swift</a>.</p><p>You can also find my code on Stack Overflow: I helped fellow developers to deal with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49763932/251839">asynchronous tasks and <code>DispatchGroup</code></a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49697684/251839">borderless <code>NSWindow</code></a>, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49764689/251839">file search implementations</a>.</p><p>I recently rebuilt my website using Swift. Take a look at my blog post "<a href="/posts/2020-03-03-Relaunching-my-website-using-Swift">Relaunching my website using Swift</a>" where i talk about my experiences and my code decisions.
